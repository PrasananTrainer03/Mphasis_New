MultiThreading : 

Thread 

  A thread is the sequential execution of path of program.

In multi-threading, more than one task can be performed in a single 
program simultaneously.  

If you want to make best utilization of CPU resources then we need the help of
multi-threading. 

In thread we have various methods as 

1) run()

	This method contains actual code to be written in threads. 

2) start()

	Once you invoke the start(), the code which in run() will be executed. 

3) sleep() 

	Makes a thread to wait for specific milliseconds time. 



How to create a thread, 

a thread will be created in 2 ways 

(i) extends Thread

(ii) implements Runnable 

implements Runnable because we cannot do multiple inheritance, so for dervied class we need to implement multi-threading, then we need Runnable interface. 

class class_name extends Thread {
...
...
}

class class_name implements Runnable {
....
....
....
}


join() : used to group one or two threads as a group. 

Synchronization : 

If two or more threads accessing the same resource at same time, then it leads to strange results. 

this problem known as synchronization. To overcome this, unless one thread leaves the particular location, another thread will not be entered. 

What is diff. between HashMap and HashTable 

HashTable is having ThreadSafe methods, as HashMap we cannot handle synchronization.
