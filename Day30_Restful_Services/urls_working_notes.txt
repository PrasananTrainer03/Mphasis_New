Webservices : 
______________

Webservices contains webmethods, that can  be called across various programming languges, 

If you want to make any method as write once and call from any programming language,
then we need the help of webservice. 

Java Programming language can initeract with PHP and .NET by using web services. 

Types of webservices : 
________________________

There are 2 types of webservices known as 

(i) SOAP based (Simple Object Access Protocol) 

	Allows you to transfer data in xml format. 

	It has various stanadards as 

	(a) UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery and Integration) 

		It is a place, where we can register and deploy the webservices. 

	(b) WSDL (Webservice Description Language)

		Generates xml vocoblury for webmethods which are there in service. 


*** Now a days no one using SOAP based services, because it transfer data in xml format only, but sometimes we need to transfer data w.r.t. Plain_Text, JSON, XML etc... various formats we need to process, then preferrably we can use Restful webservices ***

(ii) REST based 

Rest is an architectural style, stands for Representational State Transfer 

Rest Permits different data format such as Plain Text, HTML, XML, JSON etc...


Rest purely works with annotation basis, as here for class and method we need to specify @Path name, 
with that path name, we can access the resource. 

Restfull Services have 4 HTTP verbs known as 

@GET : this annotation is a request method designator and corresponds to the 
	similar to HTTP get method, When you want to Retrieve any records from 
	database, then we need the help of @GET method annotation. 

@POST : this annotation used to accept input, and post the data to database, like for Insert opeation 
	preferrably we can use @POST annotation.

@PUT : this annotation used as a requrest method which allows you to update/insert data to database. 

@DELETE : Used to perform delete resource operation. 


@Path : This annotation value is relataive to uri path indicating the alias name for class or method. 

@Produces : Used to specify the MIME type (Multipurpose Internet Mail extension), which represents the type of data we are returning from the service method. 

	Probably we can return PLAIN_TEXT, HTML_TEXT or APPLICATION_JSON these MIME types we can use. 

for Restful services, here we are using jersey framework version 2.25.1 we are using. 

@PathParam : This annotation allows you to pass parameters with the url address. 

@Consumes : Used to specify the MIME mediatype of representation that can be given as input.
