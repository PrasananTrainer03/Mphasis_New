enumeration means :

collections of constant values. 

SimpleDateFormat used to convert Date to string and String to date. 

SimpleDateFormat sdf = new SimpleDateFormat("dd-MM-yyyy");

sdf.format() : used to convert date to string. 

sdf.parse() : used to convert String to date. 

throw keyword : 

	if you want to throw the Exceptions based on the condition, then we need the help of throw keyword. 

means, write a program as accept a number, if number < 0 then throw ArithmeticException, if number = 0 then throw NumberFormatExcption, else print the number, 

Difference between throws and throw keyword 
___________________________________________

throws will be at class level

throw will be at code level

throws keyword allows you to throw Exception class. 

throw keyword will throw an exception object. 

System exceptions are inadequate in all the situations, then we need the help of
custom excepitons. Any class, that which derived from Exception can be treated as
custom exception. 


Write a program as accept age, if age < 18 then throw Exception as VotingException. 
else print the age. 

Write a program sum of 2 numbers, if any number < 0 then throw NegativeException, if any number = 0 then
throw NumberZeroException else print the sum. 

Collections :

1) Scanner :

	Used to accept data from keyboard or file etc...

	Scaner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

	next() -> used to read a word

	nextLine() -> Used to read a sentence

	nextInt()

	nextDouble()

	nextBoolean()


What is Drawback with Arrays : 
______________________________


Arrays are basically static data structures, means as we cannot  redefine the size.

This is tedious sometimes, for this we need the help of Collections. 

Collections : 

A collection is an object that contains a group of objects within it. These objects are called the elements of the collection.  The elements of collectin descend from a common parent type.  Collections have an adv. over arrays that collectino can grow to any size unlike arrays. 

Constructors : 

1. CollectionName() -> Creates an empty collection. A void  constructor does not accept any arg.

2. CollectionName(Collection col1) : Creates a new collection that accepts a collection as an arg. and returns the collection containsing the same elements as the collection arg. 

List Interface : This interface extends the collection to handle sequence or a list of objects. Elements can be inserted in a list and can be accessed from a list using their index pos. in the list. 

	Allows you to store group of values in the given collection, then we need the help of List interface.

	ArrayList, LinkedList are falling under List interface.

Wrapper classes : If you want to store data types as object, these are called wrapper classes. 

int x=12;

Integer x = new Integer(12) -> this is called wrapper class. 

double x=12.6;
Double x = new Double(12.6) -> Wrapper class. 



Set interface : This interface extends the Collection interface to handle sets containing unique elements.  This interface does not allow any duplicate elements in a set. 

HashSet and LinkedHashSet are falling under Set interface. 

diff between HashSet and LinkedHashSet is HashSet dispalys data in random order,
where LinkedHashSet displays data in insertion order. 




SortedSet interface : Used to extends the Set interface to handle the sorted sets. The elements of a set are ordered in ascending order in a sorted set.  

	Allows you to display data w.r.t. Sorting Order. Here TreeSet is falling under SortedSet interface.
