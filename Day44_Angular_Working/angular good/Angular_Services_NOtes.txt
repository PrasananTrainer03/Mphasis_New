You can pass parameters through angular routes by using 

snapshot parameters. 

Services : 

Contains code that can be accessable across multiple components. 

You can create a service by using command as 

ng g service service_name 

There are 2 types of services as 


1) Angular Services

2) Http Services 

In Angular Services, we have service code, that can be used across multiple components. 

Http Services allows you to access the external http service data 



Http Services allows you to bind external data to the component. 

To Start with http Services 

npm i @angular/http@latest 

Next, go to app.module.ts file

Write the below code as 

import {HttpModule} from '@angular/http';

Please import that in imports section also

  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    FormsModule,
    HttpModule,
    AppRoutingModule,
  ],

When you invoke a service, by default it returns promise values. 

Promise values are resolve and reject.

If service successfully running then it return resolve 

If service throws an error, then it returns reject. 

To Capture the promise values, in angular we have Observables. 

	Observables can help manage async data and a few other useful patterns. Observables are similar to Promises but with a few key differences. The first is Observables emit multiple values over time. For example a Promise once called will always return one value or one error. This is great until you have multiple values over time. Web socket/real-time based data or event handlers can emit multiple values over any given time.



	Observables allows you to manage asynchronous data

	Observable can trasmit more than one value over the time. 

	Observables can be cancellable. 

To Install observable we have to give the command as 

npm i rxjs-compat --save 

map() : Used to map json data to the angular observable class objects.
