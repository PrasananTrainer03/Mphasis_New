What is Webapplication

These are the applications, that which are to be
called from various places rather than where they are created.

If you want to make any distributed or robust applications,
then we need the help of web applications. 

You can create web applications in 2 ways as 

(i) Scripting Languages

(ii) Programming Languages 

Scripting languages are languages, that which are interpreted
during runtime they takes lot of time to execute. 

Programming languages are langauges that which are compiled first,
during rntime they takes very less time to execute. 

In Webapplications we can implement 

(i) Client-Side

	Enables you to access the application from the client system

	No Network traffic 

	Execution will be faster. 

(ii) Server-Side 

	Enables you to access the application from the server

	Execution will be a bit slower

	Network traffic is high. 


*** Any intranet based application w.r.t. No security, please opt for client-side scripting ***

*** Any intertnet based application w.r.t. Min. Security, please opt for both client-side/server-side 
		scripting ***

*** Any internet based application w.r.t. High security, please opt for server-side scripting ***
