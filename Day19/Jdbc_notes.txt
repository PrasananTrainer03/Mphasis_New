What is Maven


For general java projects, if any external jars to be added 
either we need to add to buildpath or add in the lib folder. 

But, its tedious process. To overcome this we need the help of maven. 

Maven is a build tool, that which allows you to overcome the problem of
adding external jar files to the existing project. 

It has the proper project structure. as it specifies where to write 
business logic and where to write test cases. 

as it has 2 folders as main and test main part contains actual business logic,
test part contains all the test cases. 

the heart for maven project is 

pom.xml file : (Project Object Model) 

Contains list of dependencies to be added to the given project. 


How to create a maven project

In Eclipse file -> New -> Maven Project 

For console applications, please specify in filer, please specify as

java-quickstart

Maven Project contains 4 portions as 

Group Id -> Its common name w.r.t. context
Artifact Id -> Always it is the name of the project.
Version -> Version Number
Package -> name of the packaage

To deal with JDBC, we need to use

java.sql package. 

Steps are involved in connecting to the database :
__________________________________________________


(i) Load Driver : To load the driver, please use the method as 

Class.forName() 

Before that, please add the below dependency to the project pom.xml file. 
 <dependency>
    <groupId>com.oracle.ojdbc</groupId>
    <artifactId>ojdbc8</artifactId>
    <version>19.3.0.0</version>
</dependency>


For oracle, 

Class.forName("oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver");


Add the above dependecy in pom.xml file in <dependencies> </dependencies> section. 

(ii) Connect to the Database

Connection interface is a pipeline through which we can connect to any backend. 

Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection("jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:orcl","prasanna","prasanna");


(iii) Create and Execute JDBC Statements

PreparedStatement : this interface allows you to perform crud operations. 

PreparedStatement pst = con.preparedStatement("select * from Employ");


ResultSet : To store the records that which are retrieved by the PreparedStatement, then  we need 
ResultSet. 

executeQuery() : this method allows you to fetch records from the database table. 

(iv) Handle Exceptions.
