<script>
    function show() {
       alert("Welcome");
    }
</script>

<input type="button" value="Show" onclick="show()" /> 

In the above code, there is strong binding between html and javascript code. 

this we need to avoid, then jquery is the best solution. 

Jquery allows you to create any size 0 applications.

If you want to make any light-weight applications, and 

   -> First we need to load the documents, and events will be binded at 
		whenever we want not at the time of loading the document. 


Jquery is very small software of 15kb size that plugins to be added to the document. 

“jQuery is a lightweight open source JavaScript library 
(only 15kb in size) that in a relatively short span of time has become one of the most popular libraries on the web. A big part of the appeal of jQuery is that it allows you to elegantly (and efficiently) find and manipulate HTML elements with minimum lines of code … There is a huge ecosystem and community built up around JQuery. The jQuery library also works well on the same page with ASP.NET AJAX and the ASP.NET AJAX Control Toolkit.”


Whatever code you are writing in javascript for 15 to 20 lines, by using jquery, we can write in 4 to 5 lines

It reduces the size of the program. 


jQuery is the star among the growing list of JavaScript libraries. A few of its characteristics are light-weight, cross-browser compatibility and simplicity. A common task that sometimes takes 10 lines of code with traditional JavaScript can be accomplished with jQuery in just one line of code. 


How to access the elements in jquery, 

We have $ symbol to access the elements of jquery. 

Here, $ we call as magic $. 

Assume we have <p id="p1"> 

You can access as $p("#p1")

we have <p class="p1">

you can access as $p(".p1")

Document.Ready() 

The most commonly used command in jQuery is Document.Ready(). It makes sure code is executed only when a page is fully loaded. We often place code blocks inside this Document.Ready() event. For example:

$(document).ready(function(){ 

});

To work with jquery plugins, we need to add the below scripts to the <head></head>

   <script src="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-1.10.2.js"></script>
    <script src="http://code.jquery.com/ui/1.11.2/jquery-ui.js"></script>
