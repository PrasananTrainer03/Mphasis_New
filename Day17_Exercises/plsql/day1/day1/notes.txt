Types of Commands : 

DDL commands (Data Definition Language) 

create table table_name
create user user_name

truncate table table_name
drop table table_name
drop user user_name



DML commands (Data Manipulation Language)

insert, update and delete 

insert table_name values(?,?,?,?)

update table_name set field1=newvalue,field2=newvalue....

DCL command (Data Control language)

DQL Command (Data Query Language) 

Data Types : 

number -> Syn

 number(size,dec) : number(9,2)

 char -> Used to store text data. 

  char(10) -> means u can store 10 chars. of data. 

  varchar2(10) -> This is also used to store char. data but no redundancy will be there. 

For suppose you have created char(15) and used only 7 chars then remaining 8 chars are wasted. 

But if you take varchar2(15) and used only 7 chars then the remaining are added to the memory. 

datetime -> Used to store the date type of information.

EMP(empno,name,dept,desig,basic)

empno -> number
name -> varchar2
dept -> varchar2
desig -> varchar2
basic -> number 

To Create a table, we need the help of Create Table command. 

syntax : 

create table table_name
(
    field1 data-type,field2 data-type,field3 data-type ....
);

eg : 

 create table emp
 (
    empno number(5),
    name varchar2(15),
    dept varchar2(15),desig varchar2(15),basic number(9,2)
 )

dept(dno,dname,loc,size)

dno -> number
dname -> varchar2
loc -> varchar2
size -> number

 create table dept
 (
     dno number(5),
     dname varchar2(15),
     loc varchar2(15),
     cnt number(5)
 )

select command is used to list out the records of a table. 


To retrive the list of tables, then we need the help of the following command. 


To Display the list of attributes of a table you need to give the command as 

desc table_name.

Assume the table name is emp, then you need to give the command as

desc emp

To insert the data into the table then you need the help of insert command. 
____________________________________________________________________________

syntax : 

insert into table_name values(val1,val2,val3....)

Except number fields every value needs to be enclosed in single quotes(');

 insert into emp values(1,'kumar','sql','senior',19443)

insert into emp values(&eno,'&name','&dept','&desig',&basic);
insert into emp values(&eno,'&name','&dept','&desig',&basic);

student(sno,name,sub1,sub2,sub3,tot,aveg)


sno -> number
name -> varchar2
sub1 -> number
sub2 -> number
sub3 -> number 
tot -> number
aveg -> number 

 create table student
 (
    sno number,name varchar(15),sub1 number,sub2 number,sub3 number,tot number,aveg number(9,2)
 );

create table student
(
   sno number,
   name varchar2(15),
   sub1 number,sub2 number,sub3 number,
   tot number,
  aveg number(9,2)
);

If you want to enter partial data, then you need to give the command as 


insert into table_name(fields) values(.....)

insert into student(sno,name,sub1,sub2,sub3) 
values(1,'kumar',66,88,66)
